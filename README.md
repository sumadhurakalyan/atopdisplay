  1         Linux kernel release 4.x <http://kernel.org/>

  3 These are the release notes for Linux version 3.  Read them carefully,
  4 as they tell you what this is all about, explain how to install the
  5 kernel, and what to do if something goes wrong.

  7 WHAT IS LINUX?
  8 
  9   Linux is a clone of the operating system Unix, written from scratch by
 10   Linus Torvalds with assistance from a loosely-knit team of hackers across
 11   the Net. It aims towards POSIX and Single UNIX Specification compliance.
 12 
 13   It has all the features you would expect in a modern fully-fledged Unix,
 14   including true multitasking, virtual memory, shared libraries, demand
 15   loading, shared copy-on-write executables, proper memory management,
 16   and multistack networking including IPv4 and IPv6.
 17 
 18   It is distributed under the GNU General Public License - see the
 19   accompanying COPYING file for more details.

 21 ON WHAT HARDWARE DOES IT RUN?
 22 
 23   Although originally developed first for 32-bit x86-based PCs (386 or higher),
 24   today Linux also runs on (at least) the Compaq Alpha AXP, Sun SPARC and
 25   UltraSPARC, Motorola 68000, PowerPC, PowerPC64, ARM, Hitachi SuperH, Cell,
 26   IBM S/390, MIPS, HP PA-RISC, Intel IA-64, DEC VAX, AMD x86-64, AXIS CRIS,
 27   Xtensa, Tilera TILE, AVR32 and Renesas M32R architectures.
 28 
 29   Linux is easily portable to most general-purpose 32- or 64-bit architectures
 30   as long as they have a paged memory management unit (PMMU) and a port of the
 31   GNU C compiler (gcc) (part of The GNU Compiler Collection, GCC). Linux has
 32   also been ported to a number of architectures without a PMMU, although
 33   functionality is then obviously somewhat limited.
 34   Linux has also been ported to itself. You can now run the kernel as a
 35   userspace application - this is called UserMode Linux (UML).

 37 DOCUMENTATION:
 38 
 39  - There is a lot of documentation available both in electronic form on
 40    the Internet and in books, both Linux-specific and pertaining to
"README" 412L, 18736C                                                                                                           1,30          Top
